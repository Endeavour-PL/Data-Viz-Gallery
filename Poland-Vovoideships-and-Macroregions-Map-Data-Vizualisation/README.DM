# Poland Provinces and Macroregions GeoJSON Data

This folder contains GeoJSON files for Poland's administrative divisions and macroregions, which can be used for various data visualization purposes.

### Original Data
- The original **Poland provinces** data is available under the **MIT License (2016)** from the repository:
  - **Source:** [Power BI Shape Maps by Tobi-DataDetective](https://github.com/Tobi-DataDetective/Power-BI-Shape-Maps/tree/master)
  - This dataset represents the administrative provinces (voivodeships) of Poland, available as **Poland-Vovoideships_v01.json**.

### Edits and Customizations
- The original dataset was modified by me, **Filip Jasi≈Ñski**, to correct spelling errors and standardize the formatting for better use in data visualizations. 
  - These edits include:
    - Fixes to the spelling and capitalization of voivodeship names.

- Additionally, I created a new dataset by aggregating the provinces into **macroregions** (in Polish). The file **Poland-Macroregions_v01.json** contains the updated data, which divides the provinces into the following macroregions:
  - South-Western
  - Northern
  - Eastern
  - North-Western
  - Central
  - Southern
  - Mazowieckie Region (separate from other macroregions)
